# cfxr-proxmox-gpu-passthrough
The purpose of this project is to automate GPU passthrough for Proxmox based systems.
Proxmox is a Debian based hypervisor that can be managed via a web interface. It is installed similar to any other Linux distribution.
GPU passthrough gives direct control of a GPU or other PCI device via a VM.
More information can be found from the Colfax Research article: [GPU passthrough on Proxmox](https://research.colfax-intl.com/?p=14401)

The automation consists of the `setup_gpu_passthrough.sh` script.
When executed, the script provides six options:
1. Check if VT-x/AMD-V and IOMMU are enabled
2. Enable GPU passthrough
3. Verify GPU passthrough
4. Compile VBIOS ROM (AMD GPUs via ACPI VFCT table)
5. Revert changes
6. Quit

## Check if VT-x/AMD-V and IOMMU are enabled
This option will check if the appropriate CPU virtualization and IOMMU features are enabled.

## Enable GPU passthrough
This option will make the necessary changes to allow Proxmox to passthrough a GPU device to a VM.
Once passthrough is enabled and assigned to a VM, the GPU device cannot be shared between the VM and host or other VMs.

## Verify GPU passthrough
This option will verify that the VFIO driver is properly bound to the GPU device. If it isn't, it will return an error message.
Note: this option assumes that you have added the GPU device to a VM. If you have not, then it may return an error.

## Compile VBIOS ROM
This option extracts AMD VBIOS ROMs from the system's ACPI VFCT table and installs them to `/usr/share/kvm/` for use with VM configurations.

## Revert changes
This option will revert any changes that the script makes to GRUB, kernel modules, and VFIO modprobe configuration. It will not delete custom files, simply reverting the configuration applied by the automation.

## Quit
Exits the script.

Use at your own discretion. Tested on new installation of Promox VE 8.2.2.
